Void is a simple text editor written in C, primarily built to learn lower level systems operations.

### How to use

- Clone the repo into your desired directory
- Goto that directory and type "make" to build the binary
- type "./void <enter file name>"

You will now be using void. Quick note, if you don't specify a file name, then 
a file named "newvoid.txt" will be made for you in the current directory. If 
you supply a file name that does not exist, that file will be created for you in 
the current directory.


### Current controls 

- CTRL + s | save file
- CTRL + q | quit program
